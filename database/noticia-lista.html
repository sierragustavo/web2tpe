        <h2>Shadowlands Mythic+ Affix Updates</h2>
        <h3>Changes to Sanguine, Grievous, Explosive, Volcanic, Bursting</h3>
        <h3>Blizzard</h3>
        <p>With the latest update to the Shadowlands Beta, we’re now testing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All eight Mythic Keystone Dungeons</li>
            <li>Changes to existing affixes</li>
            <li>The new Seasonal Affix: Prideful</li>
            <ul>
                <li>“Players overflow with pride as they defeat non-boss enemies, eventually forming a Manifestation of
                    Pride.
                    Defeating this Manifestation greatly empowers players.”</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <p>Players on the Torghast Beta realm can speak with the Keystone Vendor in Oribos to acquire test Keystones for
            all available dungeons and affixes.</p>
        <p>We’ve updated a number of existing affixes, with the goal of making them better fit with Shadowlands dungeons
            and adding more opportunities for class utility to shine.</p>
        <ul class=blue-box>
            <li>Bursting</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Now a Magic effect that can be dispelled.</li>
                <li>Damage is now a flat amount that scales with keystone level, rather than a % of players’ maximum
                    health.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li class="italic">Developers’ notes: While % damage made this affix feel very consistent, it also
                        led to an odd
                        interaction where having more Stamina felt like a penalty instead of a bonus.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Volcanic</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Damage is now a flat amount that scales with keystone level, rather than a % of players’ maximum
                    health.
                </li>
                <li>Added functionality: Players hit are now knocked high into the air.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li class="italic">Developer's notes: As responsibility for this affix is often placed Healers, it
                        felt appropriate to shift its emphasis from damage to disruption.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Sanguine</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Duration reduced to 20 seconds (was 60 seconds)
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li class="italic">Developers’ notes: While players have many options to deal with Sanguine, we
                        recognize that it can feel rough in dungeons with many tight corridors. Reducing the duration of
                        Sanguine pools should make their placement feel less restrictive in those dungeons (especially
                        the aptly-named Sanguine Depths).
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Grievous</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Damage is now a flat amount that scales with keystone level, rather than a % of players’ maximum
                    health.
                </li>
                <li>Added Functionality: Non-periodic heals now remove 1 application of Grievous Wound.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li class="italic">Developers’ notes: This allows healers to more reliably triage the effect while
                        dealing with heavy group damage, and adds more texture to the choice between fast and efficient
                        heals.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Explosive</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Now appear slightly farther away from enemies that summon them.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li class="italic">Developers’ notes: The goal here is to make Explosives easier to see and
                        target, as they’re less likely to be directly on top of other enemies.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
